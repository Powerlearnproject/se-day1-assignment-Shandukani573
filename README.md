# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering it is the process of designing, developin and maintaning software.
it's importance is to create software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life which include communication, entertainment, healthcare and commerce

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* 1968 the first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
* 1970 a number of new methodologies are developed including structured programming and object oriented programming
* 1980 the first computer aided software engineering(CASE) tools are released

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
* Requirements - it is where we gather and document all the client needs and system requirements.
* Design - here we create high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and interphase.
* Implementation - we write codes and build the software according to the design specification.
* Testing - conduct various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
* Deployment - release the software to clients or users.
* Maintanance - providing an ongoing support, updates and enhancements to software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software Developer - responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
* Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing tests plan.
* Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution and delevery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* Intergrated Development Environments - it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g. Visual Studio
* Version Control Systems - it provides software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
* Changing requirements
* Tight deadline
* technical debt
* we can overcome these challanges by using effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies and regular reassessment of project gools and timeline. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
* Unit testing - for testing individual components
* Integration testing - for testing interactions between different components or subsystems
* System testing - for testing the entire system as a whole
* Acceptance testing - for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
* Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
* it is important because it helps in making your questions to be clear and specific.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
